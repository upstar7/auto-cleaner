# Automatic Cleaner Application

The Automatic Cleaner Application is a program that simulates the behavior of an automatic vacuum cleaner. It can navigate a rectangular grid, execute instructions, and provide the final position of the vacuum cleaner.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (https://nodejs.org)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

1. Set up the initial position, grid size, and instructions in the index.ts file.
2. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript by running the following command:
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate a dist folder containing the compiled JavaScript code.
3. Execute the program using Node.js by running the following command:
    ```shell
    node dist/src/index.js
    ```
    This will run the program and display the final position of the vacuum cleaner in the console.

### Running Tests

1. To run the unit tests for the vacuum cleaner application, use the following command:
    ```shell
    npm test
    ```
